# TPCN Luna Multi-Agent Workflow — Event-Driven Architecture

## Mission

Evolve TPCN into a hardware-realizable, event-driven predictive-coding network while preserving its core principles.

The immediate benchmark is sequential letter-stroke classification. Each stroke or stroke point is presented as subsequent temporal data rather than converting the complete character into a static image.

The workflow must support eventual:

- FPGA/VHDL implementation
- FPAA implementation
- FPGA/FPAA hybrid implementation
- bounded hardware resources
- local learning
- local energy/resource accounting
- structural plasticity
- asynchronous/event-driven computation

---

## Authoritative contract

Read [ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT.md](../../ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT.md) first. Its A01–A15 clauses govern this workflow. A12–A13 are soft/experimental, and example sizes and utility formulas are not invariants.

# 2. Branch Policy

Use:

```text
main

architecture/event-tpcn
    |
    +-- event-core
    +-- predictive-dynamics
    +-- bounded-topology
    +-- energy-utility
    +-- structural-plasticity
    +-- stroke-classifier

hardware/fpga
hardware/fpaa
hardware/hybrid

experiment/explicit-gates
experiment/event-only-gating
experiment/utility-gating
experiment/*

legacy/spatial-reservoir
```

`architecture/event-tpcn` is the integration branch for the candidate architecture.

Do not merge experimental architectural behavior into it without an Architecture Change Proposal.

---

# 3. Luna-0 — Architecture Guardian

## Responsibility

Luna-0 coordinates the other agents.

It should perform minimal implementation work.

Its primary job is preventing architectural drift.

## Responsibilities

Maintain:

```text
ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT.md
ARCHITECTURE_CHANGELOG.md
docs/architecture/
docs/architecture_proposals/
```

Review changes for:

- accidental global clock assumptions,
- global-state leakage,
- spatial-reservoir reintroduction,
- unlimited connectivity,
- unrestricted backprop replacing local learning,
- energy minimization causing trivial inactivity,
- classifier-specific logic leaking into TPCN core,
- software structures impossible to reasonably map to FPGA/FPAA.

## Luna-0 rule

When implementation convenience conflicts with architecture, implementation must adapt unless an Architecture Change Proposal is accepted.

---

# 4. Luna-1 — Event Runtime

## Goal

Create the hardware-neutral event semantics.

Implement concepts equivalent to:

```text
Event
EventQueue
LocalTimestamp
PropagationDelay
EventType
EventPayload
```

Minimum event information:

```text
timestamp
source
destination
type
payload
```

Optional fields may later include:

```text
prediction_id
credit_id
operator
priority
energy_metadata
```

## Critical requirement

Execution batching is allowed.

For example, CUDA may process thousands of ready events simultaneously.

However:

\[
\text{execution batch}\neq\text{neural timestep}.
\]

Batching must preserve causal event ordering.

---

# 5. Luna-2 — Canonical Event Neuron

## Goal

Create the smallest useful TPCN neuron.

Initial neuron should contain:

```text
TPCNNeuron
    state
    local_time

    receive_event()
    advance_state(dt)

    prediction_state
    prediction_error

    eligibility_state

    energy_state

    emit_event()
```

Avoid prematurely implementing ten pathways.

Start with the minimum computational operator necessary to establish learning.

The interface must later permit multiple operators.

---

# 6. Luna-3 — Predictive Coding and Error Events

## Goal

Ensure the model remains a predictive-coding architecture.

Given event history:

\[
e_0,\ldots,e_t
\]

produce a prediction:

\[
\hat e_{t+1}.
\]

When the next event arrives:

\[
\epsilon_{t+1}
=
e_{t+1}-\hat e_{t+1}.
\]

Represent this error through the event system.

Investigate:

- local prediction,
- delayed prediction matching,
- prediction identifiers,
- error-event propagation,
- eligibility traces,
- temporal credit.

## Acceptance test

Changing a distant neuron must not instantaneously change another neuron's prediction/error state.

The effect must arrive causally through permitted connections.

---

# 7. Luna-4 — Bounded Connectivity

## Goal

Replace spatial-reservoir assumptions with a hardware-realizable graph.

Represent:

\[
G=(V,E)
\]

with constraints such as:

\[
|\mathcal N_i^{in}|\le D_{in}
\]

and

\[
|\mathcal N_i^{out}|\le D_{out}.
\]

Support optional physical coordinates for placement/routing.

Coordinates constrain possible connectivity but are not neural features unless an experiment explicitly makes them so.

## Prepare for hardware

Model concepts such as:

```text
node capacity
fan-in
fan-out
routing distance
propagation latency
connection cost
```

Do not simulate a continuous spatial field.

---

# 8. Luna-5 — Energy and Utility

## Goal

Build a hardware-neutral local energy API.

Software reference:

```text
LocalEnergyModel
    observe_activity()
    update(dt)
    energy
    activity
```

Track useful quantities such as:

```text
events received
events emitted
neuron activations
operator activations
state changes
connection activity
```

## FPGA model

Prepare for:

\[
C[n]
=
\operatorname{popcount}
(Q[n]\oplus Q[n-1]).
\]

A local hardware clock may measure this activity.

That clock is an energy-metering clock, not the TPCN clock.

## FPAA model

Prepare for tuned continuous approximations such as:

\[
\frac{d\hat E}{dt}
=
-\frac{\hat E}{\tau_E}
+
\sum_k \alpha_kA_k(t).
\]

## Utility

Measure both energy and usefulness.

Do not implement:

```text
lowest energy = best neuron
```

Instead investigate:

\[
U=R-\lambda E
\]

and

\[
U=\frac{R}{E+\epsilon}.
\]

High-energy computation should survive when sufficiently useful.

---

# 9. Luna-6 — Sequential Stroke Dataset

## Goal

Build the first benchmark.

Do not present completed letters as static images.

Encode handwriting as a temporal event stream.

Candidate event:

```text
StrokeEvent
    timestamp
    x
    y
    dx
    dy
    pen_state
    stroke_boundary
```

Start with the dataset's native representation wherever possible.

Avoid adding information unavailable in a real streaming system.

## Sequence

```text
START_CHARACTER

stroke event
stroke event
stroke event
...

END_CHARACTER
```

Only then evaluate final character classification for the primary benchmark.

Intermediate predictions may also be recorded.

---

# 10. Luna-7 — Classification Interface

## Goal

Provide classification without contaminating the core TPCN architecture.

Initial target:

```text
26 class outputs
A-Z
```

The classifier reads activity produced by the TPCN.

Do not give internal neurons direct access to the correct label.

Labels belong to the learning/reward mechanism.

Track confidence throughout the stroke sequence where useful:

\[
P(c\mid e_0,\ldots,e_t).
\]

This lets us measure how quickly the network recognizes a character.

---

# 11. Luna-8 — Credit and Reward

## Goal

Determine which computation was useful.

Maintain local eligibility:

\[
\frac{de_i}{dt}
=
-\frac{e_i}{\tau_e}.
\]

When delayed reward/error information arrives:

\[
\Delta R_i
\propto
e_i\Delta r_i.
\]

Extend this eventually to:

```text
neuron eligibility
connection eligibility
operator eligibility
event eligibility
```

The major research question is:

> Which expensive computations materially contributed to successful prediction/classification?

This agent should coordinate closely with Luna-5.

---

# 12. Luna-9 — Emergent Gating Experiments

Do not modify the core architecture solely to prove one gating hypothesis.

Maintain three experiments.

## Experiment A — Explicit gates

Reference historical TPCN:

\[
y_i=\sum_k g_{ik}F_k(x_i).
\]

## Experiment B — Event-only gating

No explicit learned pathway gates.

A computation happens because relevant events reach it.

## Experiment C — Utility-mediated computation

Operators compete based on local event state, historical usefulness and energy cost.

Candidate principle:

\[
P(\text{operator active})
=
f(\text{event},h_i,R_i,E_i).
\]

Compare all three.

Do not assume which wins.

---

# 13. Luna-10 — Structural Plasticity

## Goal

Allow topology to evolve without violating bounded hardware constraints.

Begin with connection-level plasticity.

Possible process:

```text
inactive/unproductive connection
        ↓
utility decreases
        ↓
candidate for pruning

useful missing relationship
        ↓
local evidence
        ↓
candidate connection
        ↓
hardware constraint check
        ↓
connection created
```

Later extend to:

- operator removal,
- operator creation,
- neuron-node allocation,
- neuron removal.

Never allow structural growth to create effectively unlimited connectivity.

---

# 14. Luna-11 — Verification Agent

Luna-11 does not design new architecture.

It attempts to break implementations.

Required tests include:

```text
test_no_global_neural_clock
test_event_causality
test_finite_propagation
test_fan_in_limit
test_fan_out_limit
test_no_global_state_leak
test_no_spatial_reservoir_dependency
test_idle_network_cost
test_delayed_prediction_error
test_delayed_credit
test_energy_accounting
test_high_cost_high_reward_survival
test_high_cost_low_reward_suppression
test_bounded_state
test_deterministic_seed
```

Also test that batching events produces behavior consistent with unbatched causal execution within defined numerical tolerances.

---

# 15. Luna-12 — FPGA/VHDL Branch

Begin only after software event semantics stabilize.

Target modules:

```text
tpcn_event_cell.vhd
tpcn_event_inbox.vhd
tpcn_event_router.vhd

tpcn_local_time.vhd

tpcn_energy_arbiter.vhd
tpcn_popcount.vhd

tpcn_predictor.vhd
tpcn_error_unit.vhd
```

Energy arbiter reference:

\[
C[n]
=
\operatorname{popcount}
(Q[n]\oplus Q[n-1]).
\]

Later allow weighted hardware activity.

Do not claim this is literal physical energy without calibration.

Treat it initially as architectural switching cost.

---

# 16. Luna-13 — FPAA Branch

Investigate analog realization of:

- neuron state,
- bounded nonlinear dynamics,
- leaky temporal state,
- prediction,
- error,
- energy approximation,
- operator selection.

Energy may use continuous approximations rather than digital transition counting.

Example:

\[
\tau_E\dot E=-E+\sum_k\alpha_kA_k.
\]

Maintain behavioral compatibility with the software reference rather than attempting to reproduce FPGA switching metrics.

---

# 17. Luna-14 — Hardware Equivalence

Compare:

```text
Software TPCN
      │
      ├── FPGA implementation
      │
      └── FPAA implementation
```

Compare observable behavior:

- event causality,
- predictions,
- classifications,
- state bounds,
- connectivity constraints,
- energy/utility decisions.

Exact internal numerical equality is not required across fundamentally different hardware.

---

# 18. First Integration Model

Start conservatively.

Candidate configuration:

```text
neurons:             256
classes:              26
bounded fan-in:        8
bounded fan-out:       8

execution:
    event driven

spatial reservoir:
    disabled

explicit 10 gates:
    disabled

structural plasticity:
    initially disabled

energy accounting:
    enabled

predictive error:
    enabled

classification:
    enabled
```

Do not optimize these values prematurely.

The first objective is proving the architecture works.

---

# 19. Required Metrics

Every training run should record:

\[
A=\text{classification accuracy}
\]

\[
L_p=\text{prediction loss}
\]

\[
N_e=\text{events processed}
\]

\[
N_a=\text{neuron activations}
\]

\[
E=\text{estimated energy}
\]

\[
C=\text{active connections}
\]

and eventually:

\[
U=\text{reward-adjusted computational utility}.
\]

Report per-character values where possible.

Also track:

```text
accuracy vs events
accuracy vs energy
prediction error vs events
prediction error vs energy
events per character
activations per character
energy per correct classification
connectivity utilization
```

---

# 20. Agent Handoff Format

Every Luna agent must leave:

```yaml
tpcn_handoff:
  agent: Luna-X
  component: component_name

  architecture_invariants_touched:
    - A01
    - A04

  preserves:
    - event_driven_execution
    - bounded_connectivity

  architecture_change: false

  files_changed:
    - path/file.py

  tests_added:
    - test_name

  tests_passing:
    - test_name

  assumptions:
    - assumption

  unresolved:
    - issue

  recommended_next_agent:
    - Luna-Y
```

No agent should silently change architecture.

---

# 21. Architecture Change Proposal

If an agent discovers that an invariant should change, create:

```text
docs/architecture_proposals/ACP-XXXX.md
```

containing:

```text
Current invariant

Observed problem

Proposed change

Why implementation alone cannot solve it

Expected benefits

Expected disadvantages

Hardware implications

Learning implications

Compatibility implications

Required experiments

Rollback plan
```

The change remains experimental until reviewed.

# 23. Immediate Success Criteria

The first milestone is successful when a software TPCN can:

1. Receive letter strokes sequentially as events.
2. Operate without a global neural timestep.
3. Process only causally activated neurons.
4. Maintain bounded connectivity.
5. Maintain bounded neuron state.
6. Predict subsequent stroke information.
7. Generate explicit prediction-error events.
8. Classify the completed sequence.
9. Track local computational/energy cost.
10. Associate useful computation with delayed reward.
11. Run without the spatial reservoir.
12. Produce sufficient instrumentation to compare explicit gating against naturally emerging event-driven selectivity.

Accuracy does not need to be exceptional for Milestone 1.

Correct architectural behavior comes first.

---

# 24. Guiding Principle

TPCN should not ask:

> How can every neuron compute as cheaply as possible?

It should ask:

> Which computations are worth their cost?

The target system is therefore:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Event Driven}
+
\text{Predictive}
+
\text{Local}
+
\text{Resource Bounded}
+
\text{Utility Driven}
+
\text{Structurally Adaptive}
}
\]

The FPGA and FPAA implementations are physical realizations of those principles rather than definitions of them.
## Operational execution rules

These are role definitions for future implementation work, not a request to launch fifteen simultaneous agents. Allocate roles on demand; one worker may handle multiple roles sequentially. Keep verification independent of implementation when resources permit.

Before dispatch, Luna-0 records the repository revision, existing changes, accepted interfaces, owned files, dependencies, acceptance checks and a bounded task for each active role. Inspect actual repository instructions before assigning paths. The branch names above are proposed names; no branches are created by this documentation package. Component branches should use names such as feature/event-core rather than assuming the diagram is a filesystem layout.

Only parallelize tasks after their shared interfaces are stable and their file ownership does not overlap. Luna-2 and Luna-4 depend on Luna-1's event contract. Luna-5 and Luna-8 must agree on local activity, eligibility and delayed reward interfaces before classifier integration. Resolve interface changes through Luna-0 rather than letting workers edit shared files concurrently.

Use the [handoff template](AGENT_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md) for every completed or blocked assignment. Luna-11 records actual commands and observed results; proposed tests must never be reported as passing. Failed invariants block integration. Luna-0 integrates only compatible, verified changes, then updates the architecture changelog when a decision changes.

Experimental gating and plasticity begin after the first integrated software milestone passes. FPGA and FPAA branches begin after software event semantics are stable; Luna-14 compares both against versioned reference traces. Hardware-specific clocks, quantization and metering must not redefine neural semantics.

See [acceptance criteria](../architecture/ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md) and [proposal process](../architecture_proposals/README.md).
